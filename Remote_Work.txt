We can boot computers from external drives. Meaning that all the faff with 
Mobile Device Management, Bring Your Own Device, or Choose Your Own Device, can 
be bypassed. 
Your company issues you a thumbdrive (maybe with a thumbprint reader), which 
has a VPN client and an RDP client, and nothing else. You can boot any computer 
in the world from this, bypassing the untrusted internal OS drive, give the IP 
address of your company to the VPN client, give your SSO to the RDP client, and 
treat it like of of your company's workstations. 

Because the rest of this hypothetical plan supports entirely virtual desktops 
with persistent data in a local NAS, it is trivial to copy up another 
workstation to go over a VPN server's connection. 

TAILS Linux is about augmenting TOR. We don't need TOR instead of TLS, because 
in this scenario you identify yourself the moment you log into SSO.
