One of the services running in the cluster needs to be a local identity   
management solution. I believe the well-supported FOSS tool for that is 
FreeIPA, but am open to other FOSS options. 

Ideally, users can authenticate with 4096-bit RSA keys, like is supported by 
SSH, rather than a 256-bit password hash. (256 bits / 8 bits per character = 32 character password strength) 

The idea is that this file becomes an IaC script that technicians can plug into 
a Podman container and end up with a clean FreeIPA install.
