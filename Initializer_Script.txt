Pseudo Code:

string this_hardware = get_system_hardware();

vector<string> urls = {https://Debian/compatibilitylist, https://Arch/compatibilitylist, ...};

vector<iso_file> installers = {debian.iso, arch.iso, ...};

for (int i = 0; i < urls.size(); ++i) {
    vector<string> models = retrieve the compatibility list from url
    for (const auto& model : models) 
        if (this_hardware == model) {
            reboot from installers[i]
            automate the initial installation configuration 
        }
}

At this point, we may switch from an IaC solution like Terraform to one like 
Ansible.

if (OS == Debian) {sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade}
elif (OS == Arch) {yum ...}
...
else {cerr << "unlisted OS\n"}

Disable all services not needed for the health of the system or by Podman.
Install Podman. 
Link up with the Kubernetes on the LAN.
