To not strain our client's budgets, we'll want to make the most use of existing 
hardware. That means supporting HDDs and SSDs of all different sizes. Failure-
tolerance and backups are separate but important concerns. 

For example: 

200GB, 200GB, 500GB, 
might become
Partition the 500GB into 100GB, 200GB, 200GB. RAID1 the latter two. Make a recommendation for the addition of a 100GB HDD.

2TB, 1TB, 1TB, 1TB, 1TB,
might become
Partition the 2TB into 1TB, 1TB. RAID6 all resulting volumes. 


Of course, this work can be done manually, client to client. But it sounds like 
a fun math problem for those of us interested in that sort of thing, so why not
automate it?
